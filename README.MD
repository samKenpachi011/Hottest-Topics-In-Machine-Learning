# The Hottest Topics in Machine-Learning
![machine-learing-wordimage](./wordimage.png)

## Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, we will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. We will perform Natural Language Processing using Python, pandas, sklearn, and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.
